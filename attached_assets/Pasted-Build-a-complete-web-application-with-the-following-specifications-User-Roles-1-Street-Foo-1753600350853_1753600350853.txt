Build a complete web application with the following specifications:

👥 User Roles:
1. Street Food Vendor (user who orders raw materials)
2. Supplier (who lists raw materials and accepts orders)

💻 Tech Stack:
Use HTML, CSS, JavaScript (or React if supported), and Node.js with Express for backend (or Replit-supported backend), with working front-end and backend routing. You can use localStorage or JSON backend to simulate data storage.

📋 Pages Required:
1. Home Page
   - Welcome message
   - Two buttons: "Login as Vendor" and "Login as Supplier"

2. Vendor Login/Register Page
   - Simple login/register form
   - After login, redirect to Vendor Dashboard

3. Vendor Dashboard:
   - View raw materials list (name, price, photo)
   - Add items to cart
   - Group ordering option (multi-select vendors option - dummy UI)
   - Place Order button
   - Order success page

4. Supplier Login/Register Page
   - Simple login/register form
   - After login, redirect to Supplier Dashboard

5. Supplier Dashboard:
   - Add product (Name, Price, Upload Image, Stock)
   - View all listed items
   - View orders placed
   - Mark order as fulfilled

6. (Optional) Admin Panel Page:
   - Login as Admin
   - View vendors/suppliers
   - Approve suppliers (dummy toggle)
   - Monitor orders

📸 Image Support:
- Use dummy placeholder images or allow upload and preview
- For raw materials like: onions, tomatoes, masala, oil

🧠 Smart Functionality:
- Detect user role at login (Vendor or Supplier) and route them to correct dashboard
- Use userType flag in localStorage or sessionStorage
- Fully clickable navigation
- Use simple styling (Tailwind or Bootstrap for UI)
- All features must work (add, list, order, confirm)

🌐 Hosting:
Make sure it runs perfectly in Replit preview.
Use folders like `/vendor`, `/supplier`, and main `index.html`.

✨ Bonus (Optional):
- Responsive design for mobile
- Hindi/English switch button
- Add a sample product.json file if database isn’t used

📦 Deliverable:
- Fully working frontend + backend in Replit
- All buttons functional
- All images display
- Neat and minimal UI
